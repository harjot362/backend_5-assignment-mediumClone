            <h1>Everyone has a<br> Story to tell.</h1>
            <h2>Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share <br>insightful perspectives, useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the <br>world—without building a mailing list or a following first. The internet is<br> noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight. It’s simple, <br>beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right audience for<br> whatever you have to say.
                <br>
                <br>
                We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or<br> empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world where the most <br>sensational and surface-level stories often win, we’re building a system <br>that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for thoughtful <br>conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over packaging.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span style="background-color: gray; font-size: xx-large; font-weight: 90px;">Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective <br>understanding of the world through the power of<br> writing.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium<br>every month. Many are professional writers, but just as many aren’t — <br>they’re CEOs, computer scientists, U.S. presidents, amateur novelists,<br> and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into the world. They<br> write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping them up at night,<br> what they’ve lived through, and what they’ve learned that the rest of us<br> might want to know too.

                Instead of selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing<br> community of <a href="#" style="color: white; "><u>Medium members</u></a> who align with our mission. If you’re<br> new here, <a href="#" style="color: white; "><u>start exploring</u></a>. Dive deeper into whatever matters to you. Find<br> a post that helps you learn something new, or reconsider something <br>familiar—and then <a href="#" style="color: white; "><u>share your own story</u></a>.
